## TODOs
ðŸ”¨ Code will be released after the paper is accepted.

Due to the problem mentioned in [issue1](https://github.com/Charrrrrlie/Mask-as-Supervision/issues/1), we are still working on refactoring the code.
Please refer to [the repo of V2](https://github.com/Charrrrrlie/X-as-Supervision), which includes the main code from this project with minor modifications.
